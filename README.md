# IronProfile

## Introduction

Having a profile is one of the most common features you will need to add on your projects, so today we are going to practice creating one.

We will create a backend REST API using NodeJS and a frontend using React where users will be able to **signup, login, upload a profile picture, check their profiles and edit it.**

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - The REST API

You will start building the app creating the REST API. Create the `app` using the `irongenerator`. Then, create the **user model** so the `User.js` have the following fields:

- **username**, type String, 
- **password**, type String
- **campus**, type String. Possible values: `Madrid`, `Barcelona`, `Miami`, `Paris`, `Berlin`, `Amsterdam`, `MÃ©xico`, `Sao Paulo`, `Lisbon`,
- **course**, type String. Possible values: `WebDev`, `UX/UI`, `Data Analytics`.
- **image**, type String.

The app will need the following routes: 

| Method  |  Endpoint         |  Parameters               | Return Value |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| POST    | `/auth/login`     | username, password        | User logged  |
| POST    | `/auth/signup`    | username, password, campus, course  | User created |  
| POST    | `/auth/upload`    | file                      | User updated |
| POST    | `/auth/edit   `   | username, campus, course  | User updated |
| POST    | `/auth/logout`    |                           | OK Message   |
| GET     | `/auth/loggedin`  |                           | User logged  |

Remember to test the REST API using Postman, to make sure everything is working! :wink:

### Iteration 2 - The React App

You should create a React App using the `create-react-app`. On the `HomePage` you only need to display two buttons: `Signup` and `Login`. Each of them should redirect to the routes `/signup` and `login`.

:::
All the assets you need for the design are stored inside the `assets` folder, but for now, don't worry about that, focus on the functionality!

### Iteration 3 - Auth Service

You should create an `authService` file, where you will have all the methods to call your REST API. You have to create the following methods:

- **signup** that makes a POST request to the `auth/signup` route passing *username*, *password*, *campus* and *course* info,
- **login** that makes a POST request to the `auth/login` route passing *username* and *password*,
- **upload** that makes a POST request to the `auth/upload` route passing the *file*,
- **edit** that makes a POST request to the `auth/edit` route passing *username*, *campus* and *course*,
- **logout** that makes a POST request to the `auth/logout` route to destroy user session,
- **loggedin** that makes a GET request to the `auth/loggedin` route to check if a user is logged in.


### Iteration 4 - Signup/Login Components

You should create the `<Signup />` and `<Login />` components, where the user will be able to fill the form with the specified fields.

If the `signup` or `login` is successful, the user must be redirected to the `profile` route.

### Iteration 5 - Upload the Photo

On the profile route, the user should be able to upload a photo to the profile. In this iteration, you should create all that is necessary to upload a new profile picture and store it in the database.

### Iteration 6 - Styling your App

Feel free to style it how ever you want. :art:
Or you can use `.png` inside of the `assets` folder that you can use as a background image. Don't forget to copy the image inside public folder of your React app. Here you can check the colors:

- Gradient background color: #C1DFC4 to #DEECDD
- Green: #638165
- Red: #D0021B


Happy coding! :heart:
